[00:00.78] Somebody once told me
[00:02.90] The world is gonna roll me
[00:05.13] I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
[00:07.97] She was looking kind of dumb
[00:11.86] With her finger and her thumb
[00:13.96] In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
[00:32.96] 
[00:18.21] Well, the years start coming
[00:20.74] And they don't stop coming
[00:22.02] Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
[00:23.77] Didn't make sense not to live for fun
[00:25.91] Your brain gets smart, but your head gets dumb
[00:48.91] 
[00:28.55] So much to do, so much to see
[00:30.48] So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
[00:32.84] You'll never know if you don't go
[00:34.99] You'll never shine if you don't glow
[00:52.99] 
[00:37.55] Hey now, you're an all star
[00:40.06] Get your game on, go play
[00:41.91] Hey now, you're a rock star
[00:44.48] Get the show on, get paid
[00:46.97] And all that glitters is gold
[00:49.89] Only shooting stars break the mold
[01:06.89] 
[00:54.41] It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
[00:58.90] You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
[01:00.82] But the meteor men beg to differ
[01:02.79] Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
[01:24.79] 
[01:05.16] The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
[01:07.32] The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
[01:09.74] My world's on fire, how about yours?
[01:11.85] That's the way I like it and I never get bored
[01:34.85] 
[01:13.60] Hey now, you're an all star
[01:17.21] Get your game on, go play
[01:19.74] Hey now, you're a rock star
[01:21.90] Get the show on, get paid
[01:23.44] All that glitters is gold
[01:26.12] Only shooting stars break the mold
[01:43.12] 
[01:33.07] (Go for the moon, go, go)
[01:38.81] (Go for the moon, go, go)
[01:41.73] (Go for the moon)
[01:45.12] (Go, go, go for the moon)
[01:57.62] 
[01:48.33] Hey now, you're an all star
[01:53.91] Get your game on, go play
[01:55.94] Hey now, you're a rock star
[01:59.28] Get the show on, get paid
[02:00.60] And all that glitters is gold
[02:04.18] Only shooting stars
[02:13.68] 
[02:06.08] Somebody once asked
[02:09.76] "Could I spare some change for gas?
[02:12.14] I need to get myself away from this place"
[02:14.59] I said, "Yep, what a concept
[02:18.65] I could use a little fuel myself"
[02:21.21] And we could all use a little change
[02:39.21] 
[02:23.59] Well, the years start coming
[02:27.66] And they don't stop coming
[02:29.12] Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
[02:30.82] Didn't make sense not to live for fun
[02:33.34] Your brain gets smart, but your head gets dumb
[02:56.34] 
[02:35.78] So much to do, so much to see
[02:37.75] So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
[02:39.99] You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
[02:42.45] You'll never shine if you don't glow
[03:00.45] 
[02:44.54] Hey now, you're an all star
[02:46.99] Get your game on, go play
[02:48.79] Hey now, you're a rock star
[02:51.55] Get the show on, get paid
[03:04.05] 
[02:54.24] And all that glitters is gold
[02:56.41] Only shooting stars break the mold
[03:03.73] And all that glitters is gold
[03:07.06] Only shooting stars break the mold
